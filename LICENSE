Nous is simply an educational project, not intended for use as an actual project dependency.
As such, the code it contains (unless otherwise explicitly stated) is based (in whole or part) on examples,
tutorials, lectures, presentations, online classes, etc.

In particular, Nous is heavily based on the video lectures (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFrwDVdSrYE6dy14XCmUtRAJuhCxuzJp0) 
presented by Michael Pilquist, author of the Structures project (https://github.com/mpilquist/Structures), though neither Michael Pilquist nor
any members or contributors to Structures endorse or are in any way affiliated with Nous.  This citation is solely to indicate that the code
curently found in Nous is the result of working through Michael's "Functional Structures in Scala" video playlist and the code examples
here presents therein.

Structures itself is based heavily on Scalaz, so both licenses appear below (and must be retained for proper attribution 
when redestributing any portion of Nous).

Information contained in the Nous wiki is (unless otherwise stated) the work of Timothy Perrigo, though may directly 
(in the form of direct quotations with proper citation) or indirectly (in the form of links to resources for additional information) 
reference other sources. Every attempt at proper attribution will be made; if a citation to a specific source is missing, 
please notify the author of the Nous wiki (Timothy Perrigo) so that it can be immediately rectified.

Redistribution of the Nous wiki, in full or part, is permitted provided the following conditions are met:
1. The author of the Nous wiki (Timothy Perrigo) is properly cited.
2. Citations and attributions within the Nous wiki to their original sources are preserved, and any license conditions of those sources
must in turn be met.

Again, no contributor to Structures, Scalaz, or any other project cited endorses or is affiliated in any way with Nous.
