# nous
Nous ([meaning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nous) "mind", "intellect", or "understanding") is a
reference implementation for common functional programming type classes and instances.
Nous is simply a learning project; it's only purpose is to provide a shared space
where we can experiment and gain a better understanding of common FP constructs such as Functors,
Monoids, and various types of Monads by implementing them from scratch, as well as learning
to use some of the existing FP libraries for Scala, such as [cats](https://github.com/non/cats).

## Building nous

Nous is built using [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  To build
nous and its example programs, run: 

    sbt clean compile test
